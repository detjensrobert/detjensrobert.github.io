          # About Me

          Hello!

          ## Current Employment

          I am currently a DevOps Engineer for [OneCommons](https://onecommons.org), working to build a Free and Open
          Cloud on the [Unfurl Cloud](https://unfurl.cloud)! This involves both designing new services to enhance our
          offerings, such as deploying a Tyk API gateway for authenticating service federation, to Rails backend work
          implementing new pages in our Gitlab fork.

          ## Previous Employment

          Previously, I worked for the [OSU Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org) as a Student Systems Engineer. They
          maintain a network of servers that host open source projects, including numerous Linux distribution mirrors,
          virtual machine hosting, and mailing lists.

          Most of this job was maintaining our configuration management software, responding to and implementing changes
          from customer support tickets, and contributing to upstream OSS projects.

          ## Github Contributions

          See all of my contributions [here](https://github.com/pulls?page=4&q=is%3Apr+author%3Adetjensrobert)! Some
          notable ones are listed below:

          ### Sous Chefs

          I actively contribute to open source projects on Github, mainly in the [Sous Chefs](https://sous-chefs.org)
          community, helping to maintain community-supported [Chef](https://chef.io) configuration management cookbooks.

          Notable contributions here include:

          - [Created `dnf_module` resource](https://github.com/sous-chefs/yum/pull/195) in the `yum` cookbook to manage
            DNF module streams

          - Updated `yum-remi-chef` to [support CentOS 8](https://github.com/sous-chefs/yum-remi-chef/pull/37) and [DNF
            modules](https://github.com/sous-chefs/yum-remi-chef/pull/40)

          - Refactored [`nfs`](https://github.com/sous-chefs/nfs/pull/119),
            [`chef-acme`](https://github.com/schubergphilis/chef-acme/pull/128), and
            [`composer`](https://github.com/djoos-cookbooks/composer/pull/81) cookbooks to use modern Chef features and
            test tooling

          - [Refactored and merged](https://github.com/sous-chefs/selinux/pull/79) `selinux_policy` cookbook into
            `selinux` with improved resources and tests

          - Creator and maintainer of `flatpak` cookbook (https://github.com/detjensrobert/flatpak-cookbook) for
            managing Flatpak applications

          ### Discord Bots

          I have created and worked on several Discord bots in various languages:

          - Created [The Bishop](https://github.com/church-of-evan/the-bishop) for the largest Computer Science help
            server at OSU

          - Contributed to the [OSUSEC Discord Bot](https://gitlab.com/osusec/discord-bot/) for the OSU Security Club,
            including a [command-bot refactor](https://gitlab.com/osusec/discord-bot/-/merge_requests/28) and [on-demand
            AWS instance creation](https://gitlab.com/osusec/discord-bot/-/merge_requests/53)
